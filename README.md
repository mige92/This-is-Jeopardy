# This-is-Jeopardy
This is my solution for the Data Manipulation Challenge Project 'This is Jeopardy' within the Data Science Career Path from Codecademy.


My goals for this project are:
1. Changing the column names in the dataset.
2. Filter the dataset for questions containing specific words.
3. Computing the average difficulty of questions containing specific words.
4. Counting the unique answers to all of the questions in the dataset.
5. Investigating the ways in which questions change over time by filtering by the date.
6. Finding a connection between the round and the category.
8. Building my own quiz.
